## Key Market Anomalies and Behavioral Explanations




1. Momentum Effect
Momentum is the tendency for stocks with strong past performance to continue performing well in the short to medium term (3-12 months). This pattern contradicts random walk theory and appears universally across global equity markets, commodities, and currencies Wright ResearchOxford Academic.
Behavioral explanation: Psychological biases drive momentum through herding behavior, confirmation bias, and overconfidence. Investors follow trends rather than making independent decisions, amplifying price movements Cambridge Core. The evidence internationally suggests slow diffusion of news best explains momentum, as investors underreact to information due to cognitive limitations Oxford Academic.

2. Long-Term Overreaction (Winner-Loser Effect)
De Bondt and Thaler's research showed that stocks with the worst past performance (losers) significantly outperformed winners over three-to-five year periods, with cumulative returns averaging 25%. This long-term mean reversion represents substantial market inefficiency Wiley Online LibraryScienceDirect.
Behavioral explanation: Investors systematically overreact to dramatic news by violating Bayes' rule, overweighting recent information and underweighting base rates.

3. Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD)
PEAD is the tendency for stock prices to continue drifting in the direction of earnings surprises for several weeks or months following earnings announcements. This is one of the oldest and most persistent capital market anomalies, first documented by Ball and Brown in 1968 Wikipedia.
Portfolios based on earnings surprises earn annual abnormal returns between 10-25% Caltech. Bernard and Thomas found that investors fail to incorporate the implications of current earnings for future earnings, with stock prices only partially reflecting a naive seasonal random walk earnings expectation Wikipedia.
Behavioral explanation: Investors systematically underreact to earnings-related news due to limited attention and failure to understand earnings persistence. Francis et al. found that underreaction to earnings announcements causes PEAD Wikipedia.

4. Disposition Effect
The disposition effect is investors' tendency to sell winning positions too early and hold losing positions too long. Odean found that stocks trading at a gain were almost 60% more likely to be sold than stocks at a loss Wikipedia.
This bias has been empirically documented across individual investors, professional traders, and international markets. It's linked to important pricing phenomena like post-earnings announcement drift and momentum PubMed CentralPrinceton.
Behavioral explanation: The disposition effect stems from loss aversion (losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good) and regret avoidance. Investors delay realizing losses to avoid the pain and regret associated with admitting a mistake The Decision LabNeuroprofiler.

5. Value Effect (Low P/E Anomaly)
The value effect shows that stocks with lower price-to-earnings ratios consistently outperform those with higher P/E ratios, contrary to EMH's assumption that stock prices fully reflect available information Cambridge Core.
Behavioral explanation: The behavioral view argues that the book-to-market factor's return premium results from investor overreaction that happens to be correlated across firms in a way that mimics a risk story Digital Commons.

6. Size Effect
Small-cap stocks earn higher average risk-adjusted returns than large-cap stocks, even after controlling for market risk and firm value. This effect is more pronounced than previously thought University of Arkansas.
Behavioral explanation: Small firms receive less analyst coverage and investor attention, leading to greater information asymmetry and slower price discovery.

7. Investor Sentiment Effects
Baker and Wurgler found that when sentiment is low, subsequent returns are relatively high for small, young, volatile, unprofitable, non-dividend-paying, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, these stocks earn relatively low subsequent returns SSRN.
Behavioral explanation: Emotional factors like fear and greed significantly influence market behavior, with emotional responses often overriding rational analysis, leading to panic selling during downturns and exuberant buying during bull markets

Lecture Outline: From CAPM to Anomalies - Risk vs. Mispricing
Part 1: The CAPM Foundation (15-20 minutes)
1.1 Introduction to CAPM

The basic model: E[R_i] = R_f + β_i(E[R_m] - R_f)
Core assumptions:

Investors are mean-variance optimizers
Homogeneous expectations
No transaction costs, taxes, or restrictions
All investors can borrow/lend at risk-free rate
Single-period investment horizon



1.2 CAPM's Key Predictions

Only systematic risk (beta) matters for expected returns
Idiosyncratic risk can be diversified away
The market portfolio is mean-variance efficient
Security Market Line (SML): linear relationship between beta and expected return

Teaching tip: Use a visual showing the SML and how individual securities should plot on it
1.3 Why CAPM Matters

Cost of capital calculations
Performance evaluation (Jensen's alpha)
Benchmark for "normal" returns
Foundation for understanding risk-return tradeoff


Part 2: The Joint Hypothesis Problem (15-20 minutes)
2.1 Fama's Critique (1970)

"The hypothesis that prices properly reflect available information must be tested in the context of a model of expected returns"
Cannot separate:

Market efficiency (are prices "right"?)
Asset pricing model validity (is CAPM the correct model?)



2.2 The Fundamental Problem
When we test CAPM and find violations, we face an identification problem:
Observed: Alpha ≠ 0 (abnormal returns exist)

Two possible interpretations:
1. Markets are inefficient (behavioral/mispricing view)
   → Prices don't reflect fundamentals
   → Exploitable opportunities exist
   
2. CAPM is wrong (rational/risk view)
   → Missing risk factors
   → Alpha represents compensation for unmodeled risk
2.3 Practical Implications

When tests reject CAPM, we cannot definitively say whether:

Assumption of rational pricing failed, OR
Other CAPM assumptions violated (market proxy, homogeneous expectations, etc.)



Key quote to use: "When tests reject the CAPM, one cannot say whether the problem is its assumption that prices are rational (the behavioral view) or violations of other assumptions that are also necessary to produce the CAPM" Tuck School of Business

Part 3: Empirical Anomalies - Violations of CAPM (20-25 minutes)
3.1 What is an Anomaly?

Patterns in returns that cannot be explained by CAPM
Persistent, statistically significant deviations from predicted returns
Should not exist in efficient markets with correct pricing model

3.2 Major Documented Anomalies
Create a table showing:

(1972)
3.3 The Flat Security Market Line

Empirical work shows the relation between beta and average return is flatter than predicted by the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM Tuck School of Business
High-beta stocks earn less than predicted
Low-beta stocks earn more than predicted

Visual aid: Show actual vs. predicted SML

Part 4: Two Competing Explanations (25-30 minutes)
This is the core of your lecture—the distinction between risk-based and behavioral explanations.
4.1 The Rational/Risk-Based View
Core argument: Anomalies reflect omitted risk factors, not mispricing
Example: Fama-French Three-Factor Model
E[R_i] - R_f = β_i^M(E[R_m] - R_f) + β_i^SMB(E[SMB]) + β_i^HML(E[HML])

SMB (Small Minus Big): Captures size effect
HML (High Minus Low): Captures value effect

Rational interpretation:

Small stocks and value stocks are fundamentally riskier
They have higher loadings on systematic risk factors beyond market beta
Higher returns compensate for bearing these additional risks
Not exploitable because you're bearing real risk

What makes it "risk"?

Linked to bad times/states of the world
Covaries with investor marginal utility
Cannot be arbitraged away because it represents fundamental uncertainty

Strengths of risk view:

Factors capture covariation in returns
Portfolios sorted on characteristics show common variation
Consistent with ICAPM or APT frameworks

Weaknesses:

Hard to identify economic sources of risk ex-ante
Why is small size or high B/M inherently risky?
Large standard errors in estimating risk premiums make even CAPM estimates rather meaningless Tuck School of Business


4.2 The Behavioral/Mispricing View
Core argument: Anomalies reflect systematic errors in investor valuation
Key mechanism:

Behavioral biases create mispricings
Limits to arbitrage prevent correction
Patterns persist and appear as "risk factors"

Example: Value Effect as Overreaction
Behavioralists argue that the book-to-market factor's average return premium is itself the result of investor overreaction that happens to be correlated across firms in a way that just looks like a risk story Digital Commons
The behavioral story for value:

Investors overreact to bad news → growth stocks overvalued
Investors overreact to good news → value stocks undervalued
Eventually prices revert to fundamentals
"Value premium" = correction of past mistakes

Evidence for behavioral view:

Investor Sentiment Effects

Baker and Wurgler found that when sentiment is high, small, young, volatile, unprofitable, non-dividend-paying stocks earn relatively low subsequent returns. When sentiment is low, these stocks earn high returns SSRN
Pure risk factors shouldn't vary with sentiment


Post-Earnings Announcement Drift

Stocks continue drifting in the direction of earnings surprises for weeks or months after announcements, with abnormal returns between 10-25% annually Wikipedia
Suggests underreaction to information, not risk compensation


Disposition Effect Impact

The disposition effect—investors' tendency to sell winners too early and hold losers too long—has been linked to momentum and post-earnings drift Princeton
Hard to reconcile with rational risk pricing


Return Predictability Patterns

If risk-based, high expected returns should come when risk is high
Often we see the opposite: high returns follow periods of low valuations (when "risk" was supposedly low)



Strengths of behavioral view:

Provides psychological micro-foundations
Explains why patterns persist (limits to arbitrage)
Consistent with laboratory and field evidence on biases

Weaknesses:

Many ad-hoc explanations for different anomalies
Hard to distinguish ex-ante which biases matter when
If exploitable, why don't smart investors eliminate them?


4.3 The "Timeworn Impasse"
The conflict between the behavioral irrational pricing story and the rational risk story for the empirical failures of the CAPM leaves us at a timeworn impasse Tuck School of BusinessDigital Commons
Key framework for students:
When evaluating any anomaly, ask:

RISK-BASED:
✓ Does it covary with bad economic states?
✓ Is it persistent across time/markets?
✓ Does it capture systematic covariation?
✓ Can you identify the economic risk?

MISPRICING-BASED:
✓ Is there a behavioral bias that explains it?
✓ Are there limits to arbitrage?
✓ Does it vary with sentiment/attention?
✓ Is there evidence of correction over time?

Part 5: Practical Implications and Tests (15-20 minutes)
5.1 How Do We Distinguish Risk from Mispricing?
Test 1: Economic Intuition

Can we tell a coherent story about why this is risky?
Example: Value stocks might be distressed, earnings more volatile
Counterpoint: Is being "small" inherently risky?

Test 2: State-Dependence

Risk premiums should be high when times are bad
Long-run sentiment component negatively associates with subsequent returns, while short-run sentiment positively varies with contemporaneous returns Springer
Suggests sentiment-driven mispricing, not risk

Test 3: Arbitrage Constraints

If mispricing, should be stronger when arbitrage is costly
Anomaly momentum is more pronounced when market is less liquid and among high idiosyncratic volatility anomalies Lehigh University
Evidence for behavioral view

Test 4: Investor Type

Do sophisticated vs. retail investors behave differently?
If anomaly stronger among retail-heavy stocks → suggests mispricing

5.2 Why This Matters
For practitioners:

If risk: Cannot exploit without bearing fundamental risk

Should include factors in cost of capital
Performance evaluation needs multi-factor models


If mispricing: Potentially exploitable

Arbitrage opportunities exist (with limits)
Risk-adjusted alpha is real



For academics:

Guides research on asset pricing models
Informs market efficiency debates
Helps develop better factor models


Part 6: Modern Resolution Attempts (10-15 minutes)
6.1 The Factor Zoo

Harvey, Liu, Zhu (2016): Over 300 factors documented
Multiple testing concerns
Many don't survive out-of-sample

6.2 Hybrid Views

Some anomalies may be risk-based
Others behavioral
Reality: Probably both mechanisms operate

6.3 Recent Developments

Machine Learning Approaches

Can we predict returns better with hundreds of characteristics?
Still faces joint hypothesis problem


Direct Tests of Mispricing

Studies constructing explicit mispricing factors that explain returns better than traditional factor models Emerald


Declining Anomalies

Some anomalies weaker post-publication
Suggests either: (a) arbitrage eliminated mispricing, or (b) data mining




Part 7: Conclusion and Key Takeaways (5-10 minutes)
Summary Points:

CAPM is elegant but empirically fails - many anomalies exist
Joint hypothesis problem is fundamental - can't separate efficiency from model specification
Two worldviews:

Rational: Anomalies = omitted risk factors → extend CAPM with more factors
Behavioral: Anomalies = mispricing → markets inefficient, limits to arbitrage


No definitive answer - the debate continues, likely both forces at work
Practical approach:

Use multi-factor models for cost of capital
Remain skeptical of "free lunches"
Understand both perspectives when evaluating investment strategies



Final thought: "Fama emphasizes that the hypothesis that prices properly reflect available information must be tested in the context of a model of expected returns. Intuitively, to test whether prices are rational, one must take a stand on what the market is trying to do in setting prices—that is, what is risk and what is the relation between expected return and risk?"
