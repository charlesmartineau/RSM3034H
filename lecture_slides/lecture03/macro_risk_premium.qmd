## Announcement risk premium

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
Ret_{t\rightarrow T} = \alpha+\beta News_t + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation*}
```

In event studies, we focus on the $\beta$ coefficient. 

In the announcement premium like, we look at the $\alpha$. Premium type:

- Macro announcement premium
- Earnings announcement premium

### Macro announcement premium

Macro announcement premium refers to the fact that a large fraction of the equity
market risk premium is realized on few trading days with significant macroeconomic
announcements. 

- Announcements: FOMC, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemp.

- 1961-2023:  44 days/yr with macro announcements ~71% of the aggregate equity market risk compensation.

- HF-data-based evidence shows that much of this premium is realized within
hourly windows around announcements, or within a few trading hours prior to the announcements.


---

### Why is the macro premium puzzling?

Presents a challenge to standard asset pricing models. 

- Breeden (1979) consumption AP model: Risk evolves slowly as Brownian motions, and as a result, the risk premium investors receive on the market portfolio will be proportional to the holding period of the asset. 

- The data on the macro announcement premium: the risk premium on most trading days is very small and even negligible. Most of the risk premium is realized on a small number of trading days where uncertainty about the macroeconomy is resolved.

### Savor and Wilson (2013)

Savor and Wilson (2013) examines the announcement premium for Announcements: PPI/CPI (whichever comes first in the month), FOMC, and Employment from 1958-2009.

### Lucca and Moench (2015)
Pre-FOMC announcement drift

![](figures/lm.jpg){.absolute width="800"}


---

### Lucca and Moench (2015)

This pre-announcement drift is a unresolve puzzle: 

- There is a disconnect between the time when the returns are earned and when the news is revealed.

- Investors may sell out of their positions ahead of the announcement. A larger share of the market risk would be borne by the specialists and would require a higher rate of return.


---

### Also a disconnect with realized volatility

### FOMC Press conferences

[Boguth et al. (2019)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/abs/shaping-expectations-and-coordinating-attention-the-unintended-consequences-of-fomc-press-conferences/16DDD90630BA52EB81CCD88171998513)

Evidence that indeed risk and expectation drives announcement date returns.

- 2011-2018: FOMC held press conferences after FOMC meetings (4/8 annual meetings). PC were known in advance. PC were introduced to make the Fed more transparent.

- Find that investors anticipate higher likelihood of changes in interest rates, greater surprises on announcement dates, and command more attention from investors for FOMC with PC.
  
- PC meetings are perceived by investors more important. Consequently, premium should be high on FOMC with PC.

### Macro announcement premium and attention

[Fisher et al. (2022)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rfs/hhac011/6535733)

Can investor attention prior to unemployment and FOMC announcement predicts risk premium?

- We argue that attention prior to meetings proxy for investor risk aversion.
  
- We measure attention using articles published in WSJ and NYT.

### Noisy FOMC returns

If large premium is realized on FOMC dates, then FOMC returns should be informative about future prices?

- Is this what we observe?

### Earnings premium

- Stock prices on average rise in the days around earnings announcements.
- This earnings announcement premium has been known at least since Beaver (1968) and has since
been studied by Chari et al (1988), Ball and Kothari (1991), and Cohen et al (2005).
- See also [Lamont and Frazzini (2007)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w13090).

Long-short strategy based on "expected" earnings announcement dates.

Argue that firm-specific uncertainty is a key driver of the earnings announcement premium.

### Earnings premium and uncertainty

[Barth and So (2014)](https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article-abstract/89/5/1579/3663/Non-Diversifiable-Volatility-Risk-and-Risk)

- They show that investors anticipate some earnings announcements to convey news that increases market return volatility and pay a premium to hedge this non-diversifiable risk. 
- This is motivated from the findings of [Patton and Verardo (2012)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/25/9/2789/1589913)

### Earnings Announcements and Systematic Risk: [Savor and Wilson (2016)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43869096) 

- Investors use announcements to revise their expectations for nonannouncing firms, but can only do so imperfectly. 
- The covariance between firm-specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky.
- Announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings.
- The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns.

### The Disappearing Earnings Announcement Premium: [Heitz et al. (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3296537)

- The authors argue that the 2004 Disclosure Regulation, which led to increasingly frequent and more comprehensive filings of material information (Form 8-K), played a role in the disappearance of the earnings premium.
