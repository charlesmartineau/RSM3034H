## Outline

## Unconditional CAPM
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
E[r_i] = r_f + \beta_i E[r_m - r_f], 
\end{align}
```

where $r_f$ is the risk-free rate, $r_m$ is the market return, and $\beta_i$ is the beta of asset $i$.

\begin{align}
\beta_i = \frac{Cov(r_i, r_m)}{Var(r_m)}
\end{align}

- Assumption: $\beta_i$ is constant over time. Agents have homogenous beliefs, are mean-variance optimizers, and have access to the same information. 

---

## Empirical tests of the CAPM

Despite its popularity in the industry, the CAPM has been subject to criticism in asset pricing research. For example, [Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=908569) and Fama and French (1992) among others document that market betas do not explain average asset returns in the cross-section.

## Other empirical contradictions to the CAPM

- [Banz (1981)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X81900180) market equity, adds to the explanation of the cross-section of average returns provided by market $\beta$. 
  
- [Bhandari (1988)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1988.tb03952.x) find that leverage helps explain the cross-section of average stock returns in tests that include size as well as $\beta$.

## Other empirical contradictions to the CAPM

- [Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400829408-007/html), and [Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1991.tb04642.x) find that book-to-market equity, BE/ME, also explains the cross-section of average returns. 
  
- [Basu (1983)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X83900314) shows that earnings-price ratios (E/P) also help explain the cross-section of average returns.

## Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass cross-sectional regression {.smaller}

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
r_{i,t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_{1} \beta_{i,t} + \lambda_{2} size_{i,t} + \lambda_{3} b/m_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{align}
```

where $r_{i,t}$ is the return on asset $i$ at time $t$, $r_{f,t}$ is the risk-free rate at time $t$, $\beta_{i,t}$ is the beta of asset $i$ at time $t$, $size_{i,t}$ is the market capitalization of asset $i$ at time $t$, $b/m_{i,t}$ is the book-to-market equity of asset $i$ at time $t$.

How do we estimate the $\lambda$'s? 

- Run a regression for each time period $t$ and then average the coefficients across time.

In Python, we use the `linearmodels` package.

## How to run a FM regression in Python

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-2|4|6"}
from linearmodels import FamaMacBeth
from linearmodels.panel import generate_panel_data

panel_data = generate_panel_data()
panel_data = panel_data.data

mod = FamaMacBeth.from_formula("y ~ 1 + x1", panel_data).fit()
```

. . .

- Make sure that panel_data.data index is a `MultiIndex` with `entity` and `time` as levels, i.e., `permno` and `date`.

. . .


- E.g., `panel_data.index = panel_data.set_index(["permno", "date"])`

## Measuring CAPM-$\beta$

How do we assign a stock's CAPM-$\beta$? Read the paper. 

- Use the market model to estimate $\beta$ for each stock.
- Form size-beta-sorted portfolios. Size: Use NYSE breakpoints.
- Estimate the portfolio betas and assign the portfolio beta to each stock in the portfolio.
  - FF92, they average the betas of individual stocks in the portfolio.

---

## Post-ranking beta

![](figures/FF92_1B.jpg){fig-align="center"}

---

## Python coding exercise

You have all the codes to replicate FF92 main results (ignore book-to-market equity for the moment).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
r_{i,t} - r_{f,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_{1} \beta_{i,t} + \lambda_{2} size_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{align}
```

How to proceed? Broad steps:

- First, create a panel data set with the required variables.
- Second, form beta-sorted portfolios and assign the portfolio beta to each stock in the portfolio.
- Third, run the Fama-MacBeth regression.

## Fama-French 1993 {.smaller}
[Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X93900235)

FF92 shows that size and book-to-market do a good job of explaining the cross-section of stock returns. 

<br>

FF93 extends FF92 in two ways:

::: incremental 
- Considers both stocks and bonds as test assets.
- If markets were integrated, a single model should also explain bond returns.
- Considers stock- (MKT, SMB, HML) and bond-related (TERM^[TERM: diff between LT govt bonds and t-bill - captures level of expected returns on bonds], DEF^[DEF: diff between return on LT bonds and LT gov bond - expected default risk.]) variables.
- Test assets are portfolios (FF25 + bond portfolios) rather than individual stocks.
- Empirical method: time-series tests rather than the cross-sectional approach of Fama-Macbeth as in FF92.
:::

---

## Fama-French 1993 

Main finding:

- SMB and HML explain the cross-section of stock returns and also bonds.


---

## Fama-French 1993

You can always use firm-level variables such as size and book-to-market to explain the cross-section. But what if the premium on size and book-to-market captures systematic risk (e.g., default) and you want to use these "risk factors" to explain other asset returns (e.g., bonds) or portfolio returns?

. . . 

- Solution: Factor mimicking portfolios.

## Factor mimicking portfolios

Data requirements

::: {.smaller}


- CRSP stock prices for December of t-1 and June of t
- Compustat book common equity for t-1
- Do not include firms until they have appeared on COMPUSTAT for two years, to address potential survivor bias (backfilling)
- Ordinary common equity included (exclude ADRs, REITs, and units of beneficial interest)
::: 

---

## Factor mimicking portfolios

June of year $t$ rank NYSE stocks on size

- All NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq stocks allocated to two groups based on NYSE breakpoints, S and B, cut on the median of NYSE market equity
- S contains about 80\% of the stocks in later years but 8\% of market value

---

## Factor mimicking portfolios


Independently create breakpoints for NYSE stock B/M ratio for low (30\%), middle (40\%), and high (30\%) groups, also in June of year $t$

- Book equity from fiscal year ending in $t-1$, ME from Dec. of $t-1$
- Omit stocks with negative BE in forming breakpoints
- Allocate NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks according to break points, excluding those with negative BE

---

## Factor mimicking portfolios


Construct six double-sorted portfolios of Size and B/M sorts: S/L, S/M, S/H, B/L, B/M, B/H

- Calculate monthly value weighted returns from July of year t to June of year $t+1$, reforming portfolios in June of $t+1$.


---

## Factor mimicking portfolios {.smaller}


Size (SMB)

- Difference, each month, between the simple average of the three small stock portfolios and the simple average of the three large stock portfolios

  - $\text{SMB} = \frac{1}{3}(\text{SL} + \text{SM} + \text{SH}) - \frac{1}{3}(\text{BL} + \text{BM} + \text{BH})$

Value (HML)

- Difference between the simple average of two high book-to-market portfolios and the simple average of two low book-to-market portfolios

  - $\text{HML} = \frac{1}{2}(\text{SH} + \text{BH}) - \frac{1}{2}(\text{SL} + \text{BL})$

## Fama-French 1993 GRS test

- Fama and French use the GRS test statistic to jointly test whether the alphas (αiαi​) of all the test portfolios are zero.
- The GRS test is designed to assess whether the factors  adequately explain the cross-sectional variation in returns across the test portfolios.

  - $\text{GRS} = \frac{T - N - K}{N} \cdot \frac{\alpha' \Sigma^{-1} \alpha}{1 + \bar{f}' \Sigma_f^{-1} \bar{f}}$ 

---

## Concerns with GRS tests

- The GRS test's results depend heavily on the chosen set of test portfolios.
- If portfolios are tailored to the factors (e.g., size and value factors for the Fama-French model), the test might favor the model even if it fails in a broader context, i.e.g., including industry portfolios.
- Other issues include GRS test assumes that factor returns and residuals are stationary over the sample period. See Harvey and Liu, 2021.
